Meow Password is a command line utility that generates random secure passwords based on a db of cat names.


catNamesText.txt contains a list of cat names. 

When a user types the commmand meowpass they should get a unique phrase based password of 20 characters that meets password security requirements.

A secure password must meet these specs :

it should be a phrase of at least 15 characters and not more then 25 with at least 3 words picked from the catNamesText file. 
it should have 3 letters randomly capitalized.
it should have a 3 to 5 numbers inserted randomly in the password string
it should have 2 symbols randomly replacing letters. 
Any repeating letters should be removed and replaced by a random digit

Create a new function that evaluates a string using Kolmogorov algorithms to just it's complexity and return verbose string evaluating the complexity of the input string.


The algorithm should:

Load the catNamesText file
randomly select 3 to five names to create a new string of 15 to 25 characters
apply the secure password specs to randomize the phrase

do this 5 times to generate 5 new phrases

output the 5 phrases to the screen and evaluate each with the Kolmogorov function we created. 

select the most secure password based on the Kolmogorov function and output that with an option to copy to the clipboard 


Add unit tests and integration tests for all parts of the algorithms.
